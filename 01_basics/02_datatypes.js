DATATYPES in JS
1. number => 2 to power 53
2. bigint
3. string => ""
4. boolean => true/false
5. null => standalone value(it basically is a special value that represents nothing or absence of a value)
6. undefined => if value is not defined to a particular variable
Null and undefined are two different things -> null is actually a value, while undefined is something that occurs when you don't assign a value to a particular variable. 
For example, if there is an API that fetches the temperature of a place and for some reason, the temperature is not available, we would prefer the value null rather than 0Â°C. 
On the other hand, if you declare a variable to hold the temperature data (let temperature;) but haven't received the data yet, the value of that variable would be undefined until it's assigned a value.
7. symbol => used to identify a unique component(used by Figma to define an individual component)
8. object
