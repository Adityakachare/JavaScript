    //A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

    function init() {
        let name = "Mozilla";
        function displayName() {
            console.log(name);
        }
        displayName();
    }
    init();


    //Understanding the concept:
    /*
    the variables declared in the function are not available in the outer space. 
    We have a Global Execution Context, when a function is defined a separate execution context is made, if an another function is defined it also has a separate execution context.
    With no error while accessing the username variable from the outer function we can observe that the two functions share memory.
    All the inner functions(irrespective of the number of inner functions) will have the access to the variables and properties of the outer function. 

    All the inner function have access to the properties of outer function but one inner function does not have access to the properties of another inner function

    Also the outer function does not have access to the properties of the inner function
    */
    function outer() {
        let username = "Aditya"
        console.log("Outer: ", secret);
        function inner() {
            let secret = "213";
            console.log("Inner", username);
        }
        function innerTwo() {
            console.log("Inner Two", username);
            //console.log("Secret Message:", secret); //secret is not defined

        }
        inner();
        innerTwo();
    }
    outer();
    console.log("Outer", username);

    /*
    CLOSURE: We will understand this concept using the following example where instead of calling the function directly we are returning the reference of the function
    When displayName is passed, not only the method but the scope of the outer function if it exists is passed. This is due to lexical scoping.
    Not only the executional context but also the memory is shared which is why this is possible.
    So in conclusion we can say that when we try to pass an entire function then not only function itself but also its scope which is the lexical scope is passed.

    function makeFunc() {
        const name = "Mozilla";
        function displayName() {
            console.log(name);

    //Practical Example
    document.getElementById("orange").onclick = function () {
        document.body.style.backgroundColor = "orange"
    }
    document.getElementById("green").onclick = function () {
        document.body.style.backgroundColor = "green"
    }
    //We successfully changed the bg color on the click of the button but if there were more number of buttons, this would be a repeated task and take our precious time. to avoid this we can use the following logic:

    function clickHandler(color) {
        //document.body.style.backgroundColor = `${color}` //doesnt work

        return function () {
            document.body.style.backgroundColor = `${color}`
        }
    }
    //This example uses closures to change the background color when buttons are clicked.The `clickHandler` function takes a `color` parameter and returns a new function that sets the background color.By assigning`document.getElementById('orange').onclick = clickHandler("orange")`, the returned function from `clickHandler` retains access to the `color` parameter due to closure.This ensures the correct color is used when the button is clicked, avoiding repeated code and potential errors from directly setting the background color without closure.
    //document.getElementById('orange').onclick = clickHandler("orange")
