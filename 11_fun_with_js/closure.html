    //A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

    function init() {
        let name = "Mozilla";
        function displayName() {
            console.log(name);
        }
        displayName();
    }
    init();


    //Understanding the concept:
    /*
    the variables declared in the function are not available in the outer space. 
    We have a Global Execution Context, when a function is defined a separate execution context is made, if an another function is defined it also has a separate execution context.
    With no error while accessing the username variable from the outer function we can observe that the two functions share memory.
    All the inner functions(irrespective of the number of inner functions) will have the access to the variables and properties of the outer function. 

    All the inner function have access to the properties of outer function but one inner function does not have access to the properties of another inner function

    Also the outer function does not have access to the properties of the inner function

    function outer() {
        let username = "Aditya"
        console.log("Outer: ", secret);
        function inner() {
            let secret = "213";
            console.log("Inner", username);
        }
        function innerTwo() {
            console.log("Inner Two", username);
            //console.log("Secret Message:", secret); //secret is not defined

        }
        inner();
        innerTwo();
    }
    outer();
    console.log("Outer", username);
