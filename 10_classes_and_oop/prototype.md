# Prototype in JS

JavaScript follows a prototypical behaviour which is its default behaviour. This feature/ behaviour of JS allows it to search for the required/desired/expected value in the DOM. It searches for it in all the layers, if not found in the child it will move to the parent, if not there it will move futher up. This is done till null value is encountered.

Allows the usage of new _keyword_, _classes_, _this_ keyword, _inheritance_ in JS.

In JS almost each and every element is an OBJECT. Object itself does not have any parent. Properties available in Object are available to all the other elements in JS such as Arrays, Strings etc. Even a function is an Object. Explanation for this with example is given in the object.js file.
